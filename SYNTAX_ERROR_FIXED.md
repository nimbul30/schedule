# 🔧 Syntax Error Fixed!

## Problem Identified:

```
Syntax error: SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token line: 128 file: Code.gs
```

## Root Cause:

The comment block `/* ORIGINAL CODE COMMENTED OUT FOR TESTING` was never properly closed with `*/`, causing a syntax error that prevented the entire Google Apps Script from executing.

## Fix Applied:

✅ **Properly closed the comment block** by adding `*/ // END OF COMMENTED OUT CODE` at the end of the original function.

## Current Status:

The `getScheduleDataForWebApp()` function now returns a simple mock response:

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  employees: [{ name: 'Test Employee', email: 'test@example.com', role: 'Manager' }],
  shifts: [{ name: 'Morning Shift', start: '09:00', end: '17:00' }],
  schedule: [],
  weekRange: 'Test Week',
  approvedRequests: []
}
```

## Expected Behavior Now:

🎯 **Refresh the webapp** - you should now see:

✅ **In the console**:

```
Simple test response: {success: true, message: "Simple test working"}
Server response received: {success: true, employees: [...], weekRange: "Test Week"}
```

✅ **In the UI**:

- User name should load (if `getCurrentUserInfo()` works)
- Week range should show "Test Week"
- Schedule table should show "Test Employee"
- Dashboard stats should populate

## Next Steps:

### If Mock Data Shows:

1. ✅ **Syntax error is fixed!**
2. ✅ **Server communication is working**
3. 🔄 **We can uncomment the original code and fix any data issues**

### If Still Getting Null:

1. ❌ **There may be additional syntax errors**
2. ❌ **The web app needs to be redeployed**
3. ❌ **Check Google Apps Script logs for other errors**

## Deployment Note:

After fixing syntax errors, you may need to:

1. **Save the script** in Google Apps Script Editor
2. **Redeploy the web app** (Deploy > New Deployment)
3. **Use the new web app URL**

The syntax error was definitely preventing the server-side code from executing, which explains the null responses! 🎉
