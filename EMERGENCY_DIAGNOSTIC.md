# üö® Emergency Diagnostic for Persistent Null Issue

## Current Status:

Still receiving `null` responses from server despite all fixes. This indicates a fundamental issue with the Google Apps Script execution environment.

## Emergency Fix Applied:

### 1. Simple Mock Response

I've temporarily replaced `getScheduleDataForWebApp()` with a simple mock response that should definitely work:

```javascript
function getScheduleDataForWebApp(startDateTimestamp) {
  return {
    success: true,
    employees: [
      { name: 'Test Employee', email: 'test@example.com', role: 'Manager' },
    ],
    shifts: [{ name: 'Morning Shift', start: '09:00', end: '17:00' }],
    schedule: [],
    weekRange: 'Test Week',
    approvedRequests: [],
  };
}
```

### 2. Added Simple Test Function

```javascript
function simpleTest() {
  return {
    success: true,
    message: 'Simple test working',
    timestamp: new Date().toString(),
  };
}
```

## What This Will Tell Us:

### If Mock Response Works:

- ‚úÖ Server communication is working
- ‚úÖ The issue is in the original data loading logic
- ‚úÖ We can proceed to fix the actual data loading

### If Mock Response Still Returns Null:

- ‚ùå There's a fundamental issue with Google Apps Script deployment
- ‚ùå The web app may not be properly deployed
- ‚ùå There may be permission issues

## Next Steps:

### 1. Refresh the Webapp

After refreshing, you should see in the console:

```
Simple test response: {success: true, message: "Simple test working", ...}
Server response received: {success: true, employees: [...], weekRange: "Test Week"}
```

### 2. If Still Getting Null:

This indicates a deployment issue. You need to:

1. **Redeploy the web app** in Google Apps Script
2. **Check permissions** - ensure the script can run as you
3. **Verify the spreadsheet ID** is correct
4. **Check if the script is published** properly

### 3. If Mock Works:

We can then uncomment the original code and fix the specific data loading issues.

## Critical Deployment Checklist:

### In Google Apps Script Editor:

1. **Deploy > New Deployment**
2. **Type: Web app**
3. **Execute as: Me**
4. **Who has access: Anyone** (or your organization)
5. **Click Deploy**
6. **Copy the new web app URL**

### Common Issues:

- ‚ùå **Wrong Spreadsheet ID**: Verify `1gO5bzfxr6bItJMOHistm-6vYC0qXGqO-maRJJ6h2h04` is correct
- ‚ùå **Permission Issues**: Script doesn't have access to spreadsheet
- ‚ùå **Old Deployment**: Using an old version of the web app
- ‚ùå **Authentication**: User not properly authenticated

## Manual Test Commands:

In Google Apps Script Editor, try running these manually:

```javascript
// This should work
simpleTest();

// This should also work now
getScheduleDataForWebApp(new Date().getTime());
```

If these work in the editor but not in the web app, it's definitely a deployment issue.

## Emergency Fallback:

If nothing works, we may need to:

1. Create a completely new Google Apps Script project
2. Copy the code to the new project
3. Deploy fresh with proper permissions

The mock response should definitely work - if it doesn't, we have a deployment/permission issue, not a code issue! üö®
