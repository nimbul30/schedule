# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive testing and error fixing for the existing employee scheduling webapp. The webapp is a Google Apps Script-based system that provides scheduling functionality for managers and employees, with features including shift assignment, time-off requests, employee management, and schedule publishing. The system needs thorough testing to identify and fix potential errors, improve reliability, and ensure all functionality works as expected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to systematically test all webapp functionality, so that I can identify and document any errors or issues that need fixing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webapp is loaded THEN the system SHALL verify all HTML files render correctly without syntax errors
2. WHEN JavaScript functions are executed THEN the system SHALL validate all function calls work without runtime errors
3. WHEN user interactions occur THEN the system SHALL ensure all event handlers respond appropriately
4. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL verify all data validation and error handling works correctly
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL confirm all Google Apps Script server functions execute successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a manager, I want all administrative functions to work reliably, so that I can manage employees and schedules without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new employee THEN the system SHALL validate the form data and prevent duplicate email addresses
2. WHEN adding a new shift type THEN the system SHALL ensure proper time format validation and storage
3. WHEN assigning shifts to employees THEN the system SHALL handle date formatting and database updates correctly
4. WHEN deleting an employee THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data and future schedule entries
5. WHEN publishing a schedule THEN the system SHALL create formatted sheets without formatting errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an employee, I want the employee view to function correctly, so that I can view my schedule and submit time-off requests without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my schedule THEN the system SHALL display accurate shift information and approved time-off
2. WHEN submitting a time-off request THEN the system SHALL validate dates and send notifications properly
3. WHEN navigating between weeks THEN the system SHALL update the display with correct date calculations
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL initialize properly and handle authentication correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling throughout the application, so that users receive helpful error messages and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical details
2. WHEN network issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide clear validation messages
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL handle unauthorized access gracefully
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want automated test coverage for critical functions, so that regressions can be detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing data functions THEN the system SHALL verify employee, shift, and schedule data operations
2. WHEN testing UI interactions THEN the system SHALL validate modal operations, form submissions, and navigation
3. WHEN testing date handling THEN the system SHALL ensure proper timezone and date format processing
4. WHEN testing permissions THEN the system SHALL verify role-based access controls work correctly
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL handle boundary conditions and invalid inputs appropriately
